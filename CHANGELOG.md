# Changelog

## [0.0.7] - 2026-08-29

`version: "0.0.7"` was introduced alongside the Kubernetes charm, so this entry
covers everything released since 0.0.6.

### Features

- Add a Kubernetes standalone charm (`jaime-k8s`) that runs as its own pod and monitors other applications in the same Juju model. Monitoring is opt-in via `watch-applications` — empty means nothing is monitored, never "all applications"
- Read k8s workload statuses from the Juju controller API (`Client.FullStatus`) using a dedicated read-only Juju user, since a unit's own agent identity lacks `ModelRead`
- Fetch a watched application's live Juju config via `Application.Get`, including which options the operator changed
- Collect pod logs, events, and metrics through the Kubernetes API using the pod's in-cluster service account — no `kubectl` binary
- Ship `jaime-k8s-rbac.yaml` granting read access to `pods`, `pods/log`, `events`, and metrics
- Add AI token usage and cost tracking: one `usage_log` entry per LLM call, preserved across incident episodes, aggregated with a per-model breakdown by the new `show-usage` action
- Add a `get-suggestion` action with an `additional-context` parameter injected into the prompt as authoritative. Suggestions are cached on the incident and regenerated only when that context or the model changes
- De-duplicate repeated log lines by normalised pattern, so a health check failing every few seconds collapses to one entry before reaching the AI provider
- Add socket statistics (`ss -antlup`) and firewall rules (iptables, ufw, nftables) report sections

### Changes

- Restructure into a monorepo: a shared `jaime-package/` library, `charms/machine/`, and `charms/k8s/`, each vendoring the library at pack time. `jaime` is a namespace package, so shared and charm-local modules merge at runtime
- Extract `CoreMixin` (`core.py`) with the substrate-agnostic behaviour — provider wiring, secret resolution, suggest/act invocation, usage tracking, shared action handlers, and the incident lifecycle state machine. Machine charm 835 -> 262 lines, k8s charm 684 -> 188
- Extract shared log helpers into `logutils.py`
- Pass the Gemini API token as an `x-goog-api-key` header instead of a URL query parameter, to keep it out of proxy logs
- Accept either a Juju secret URI or a plain string for `api-token` and `juju-api-password`
- Write the status state file atomically via a temp file and rename
- Reduce the default `log-window-minutes` from 120 to 30
- Report Juju's raw status timestamp as `status_since` in the incident events, alongside the Jaime-anchored `first_seen`
- Add `status-since` to the `show-status` action output
- Remove dead code: the Ops tracing report section and the unused `UsageMetadata.__add__`
- Sync `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `TASKS.md` with the implemented state; add Phase 3 for multi-substrate support and shift the later phases

### Bug fixes

- Anchor the incident timer to a Jaime-owned `unhealthy_since` instead of Juju's `since`. A charm retrying in a loop re-sets its workload status on every hook, which bumps `since` and previously reset the timer, so `failure-timeout-minutes` was never reached and no incident was ever opened
- Treat a continuous run of watched statuses as one episode. Flapping between two watched statuses (e.g. `maintenance` <-> `blocked`) no longer clears the open incident and cooldown, so it cannot produce repeat reports for a single failure
- Start the log-collection window at `unhealthy_since`, so the causal error at the beginning of a failure is inside the collected window
- Persist the observation increment on every observe. Each hook is a fresh process, so writing only on episode change meant the increment was reloaded from disk and never advanced past 2
- Add the missing `Incident` import to the machine charm, which raised `NameError` on every hook
- Stop `config-changed` from overwriting an open-incident display status with a plain "Ready"
- Encapsulate `StatusTracker.reset()` instead of mutating internal state from the charm
- Sort Kubernetes events safely when `lastTimestamp` and `firstTimestamp` are both absent
- Remove the `subordinate` flag from the k8s charm, which is standalone

## [0.0.6] - 2026-07-15

### Changes

- Reduce charm config in report to only option name and default value (YAML parse + extract, drop full raw dump)
- Filter unit logs to error/warning lines with context window (±10 rows) around the last chronological match
- Remove crude `" INFO "/" DEBUG "` substring filter in favour of context-window approach

## [0.0.5] - 2026-07-15

### Features

- Add OpenRouter as a second AI provider with configurable model selection
- Add provider connectivity check (`check()`) for both Gemini and OpenRouter

### Changes

- Log AI provider call results: INFO-level success/failure per provider, DEBUG-level full response
- Improve error messages in diagnostics generation to include the provider name

## [0.0.4] - 2026-07-14

### Features

- Wire diagnostics plan into collector: iterate plan sections and collect per-item data
- Add broad fallback collection when plan is empty or missing (ps aux, ss -tlnp, etc.)
- Add plan-driven Markdown report sections (log files, processes, systemd units, network ports, env vars)
- Add unit tests for plan-driven collection and report sections (23 new tests, 171 total)

## [0.0.3] - 2026-07-14

### Features

- Implement principal status monitoring with goal-state via `StatusTracker`
- Add incident lifecycle model (`Incident` dataclass) with open/close/recovery
- Add bounded context collector (Juju logs, systemd, disk, memory)
- Add plan-driven context collection: iterate diagnostics plan and collect per-section data
- Add Markdown report generation from collected context
- Add structured JSONL audit logging
- Add `show-status` and `reset` actions
- Add suggest/act mode support (gated behind mode config)
- Add test infrastructure (pytest, pyproject.toml, tox.ini, test script)
- Add unit tests for `diagnostics.py`, `providers/`

## [0.0.2] - 2026-07-05

### Features

- Add `diagnostics` config variable for monitoring plan
- Add diagnostics JSON schema and validation
- Add AI-powered diagnostics plan generation on `principal-relation-joined`
- Add Gemini provider using REST API (stdlib only)
- Create `src/jaime/` and `src/jaime/providers/` package structure
- Fall back to empty diagnostics plan when no AI provider is configured

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-21

### Features
