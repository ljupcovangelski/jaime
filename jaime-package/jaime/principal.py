    Each ``usage_log`` entry is one raw LLM call record — one entry per
    ``run_suggest`` or ``run_act`` invocation. The ``cost_usd`` field is
    absent when the provider does not report cost (e.g. Gemini).

    The per-model breakdown returned by ``show-usage`` is computed on the
    fly by ``JaimeCharm._summarise_usage`` and is not stored here.

    ``since`` is Juju's own "status last set" timestamp and is recorded for
    reporting only. ``unhealthy_since`` is Jaime's anchor for how long the
    unit has been unhealthy: it is set when the unit enters a watched status
    and held steady until the unit recovers.

    An episode is a continuous run of watched (or unwatched) observations.
    The increment, incident, and last_reported reset when the unit crosses
    that boundary — not when Juju bumps ``since`` and not when a workload
    flaps between two watched statuses. usage_log is preserved across
    episodes and never cleared.
