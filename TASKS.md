# Jaime Tasks

Phases 0 to 3.5 are implemented. Phases 4 to 6 are the active plan.

Later phases and unscoped ideas live in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, which is the roadmap
source of truth. They are deliberately not listed here until they are worth
breaking into tasks.

Ordering note: 5.1 (CI) runs ahead of Phase 4 because it is cheap and guards
every change after it. 5.2 depends on 4.1, since integration tests cannot
deploy reliably until packaging stops destroying artifacts. 5.3 depends on
4.2, 4.4 and 4.6.

## 2. Phase 2 — AI-assisted Diagnosis

Integrate AI providers to analyse persisted incident evidence, identify likely root causes, and produce advisory remediation suggestions with a complete audit trail. Nothing is executed in this phase.

### 2.1. Incident suggestion

- [x] Add provider interface
- [x] Add Gemini provider
- [x] Add OpenRouter provider
- [x] Add provider config validation
- [x] Add Juju secret/token handling
- [x] Add prompt builder
- [x] Add AI response parser
- [x] Add AI-assisted Markdown report
- [x] Ensure provider failures fall back to non-AI report

### 2.2. Suggestion engine

- [x] [python] Define `Suggestion` dataclass and attach it to the incident
- [x] [python] Add `run_suggest` — build prompt, call provider, parse commands
- [x] [python] Extract remediation commands from fenced `bash` code blocks (`parse_commands`)
- [x] [python] Add a `run_act` skeleton, unreachable until the assisted-remediation phase supplies the safety controls
- [x] [charm] Block on `mode: act` — real remediation is a later phase, not this one
- [x] [charm] Add `get-suggestion` action returning description, commands, and count
- [x] [charm] Add `additional-context` action parameter injected into the prompt as authoritative
- [x] [charm] Cache the suggestion on the incident; regenerate only when the context hash or model changes
- [x] [python] Persist the suggestion in `StatusTracker` and write a `suggestion-generated` audit event

### 2.3. Token usage and cost tracking

## 3. Phase 3 — Kubernetes / Multi-substrate Support

Support both a machine subordinate charm and a standalone Kubernetes charm from one codebase, with the substrate-independent behaviour factored into shared code.

### 3.1. Repository restructure and shared code

- [x] [python] Create the shared Jaime library containing substrate-independent business logic
- [x] [python] Make `jaime` a namespace package so charm-local and shared modules merge at runtime
- [x] [python] Extract `CoreMixin` (`core.py`) — mode/provider enums, provider wiring, secret resolution, suggest/act invocation, usage tracking, shared action handlers, incident lifecycle state machine
- [x] [charm] Move the machine charm to `charms/machine/` and reduce `charm.py` to substrate-specific hooks
- [x] [charm] Define the substrate hook contract (`_collect_incident_context`, `_collect_report_context`)
- [x] [python] Keep machine host logic and Kubernetes API logic out of the shared incident logic
- [x] [python] Encapsulate `StatusTracker.reset()`
- [x] [python] Stop `config-changed` from overwriting an open-incident display status
- [x] [python] Remove dead code (Ops tracing report section, unused `UsageMetadata.__add__`)

### 3.2. Kubernetes charm skeleton

- [x] [charm] Add `charms/k8s/charmcraft.yaml` as a standalone (non-subordinate) charm
- [x] [charm] Add `charms/k8s/config.yaml` with `watch-applications`, `juju-api-user`, `juju-api-password`
- [x] [charm] Add `charms/k8s/actions.yaml` (`show-status`, `show-usage`, `get-suggestion`, `generate-report`, `reset`)
- [x] [charm] Add `charms/k8s/src/charm.py` monitoring on `update-status` with no relation to watched apps
- [x] [charm] Make monitoring opt-in — empty `watch-applications` monitors nothing, never "all apps"
- [x] [charm] Add per-charm `README.md` and icon for CharmHub

### 3.3. Juju controller API access

- [x] [python] Add `controller.py` — WebSocket client for the Juju controller API (stdlib + websocket-client)
- [x] [python] Derive controller address, CA cert, and model UUID from the unit's own `agent.conf`
- [x] [python] Authenticate as a dedicated read-only Juju user (`Admin.Login`)
- [x] [python] Read workload statuses via `Client.FullStatus` and filter by `watch-applications`
- [x] [python] Read an application's live config via `Application.Get` (option names, values, operator-changed flag)
- [x] [python] Negotiate facade versions from the login response
- [x] [charm] Distinguish auth failure (`BlockedStatus`) from transient controller errors (`MaintenanceStatus`)
- [x] [charm] Resolve `juju-api-password` from a Juju secret URI or plain string

### 3.4. Kubernetes context collection

- [x] [python] Add `k8s_api.py` — read-only Kubernetes API client using the pod's in-cluster service account (no `kubectl` binary)
- [x] [python] Resolve the pod for a Juju unit via the `unit.juju.is/id` annotation, with a name-convention fallback
- [x] [python] Collect pod logs per container bounded by `sinceTime` and `tailLines`
- [x] [python] Collect Kubernetes events for the pod
- [x] [python] Collect CPU/memory usage from metrics-server when available
- [x] [python] Summarise the pod (phase, node, conditions, containers, images, restarts, probes, resources, volumes)
- [x] [python] Implement the same `collect_context()` interface as the machine collector
- [x] [python] Add k8s report sections (pod, events, resource usage) and a Juju config section
- [x] [python] Handle k8s events with missing timestamps when sorting
- [x] [charm] Ship `jaime-k8s-rbac.yaml` granting `pods`, `pods/log`, `events`, and metrics read access

### 3.5. Build and packaging

- [x] [charm] Vendor `jaime-package` into each charm at build time via `.vendored/` symlink and `override-build`
- [x] [charm] Add `make pack-machine`, `make pack-k8s`, and `make pack` targets
- [x] [docs] Document both charms in the root `README.md`

### 3.6. Tests

- [x] [test] Unit test `controller.py` — `agent.conf` parsing, login, facade negotiation, status extraction
- [x] [test] Unit test `k8s_api.py` — pod resolution, logs, events, metrics, error handling
- [x] [test] Unit test the k8s collector and k8s report sections
- [x] [test] Unit test `CoreMixin` once against a dummy charm instead of duplicating per charm
- [x] [test] Keep both suites green (machine 226 tests, k8s 55 tests)

## 3.5. Phase 3.5 — Test and tooling hygiene

Done before CI so the workflow encodes the intended layout rather than the
leftovers of the Phase 3 restructure.

### 3.5.1. Repository cleanup

- [x] [test] Delete the stale root `src/` and `tests/` directories left by the Phase 3 restructure
- [x] [test] Keep `charms/*/.vendored/` — it feeds each charm's pytest `pythonpath`, while the Makefile's `_jaime-package` copy feeds charmcraft

### 3.5.2. Test layout

- [x] [test] Adopt the `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` layout `AGENTS.md` documents
- [x] [test] Move shared-library tests out of `charms/machine/tests/` into `tests/unit/`
- [x] [test] Move `test_controller.py` and `test_core.py` out of `charms/k8s/tests/` into `tests/unit/`
- [x] [test] Leave only genuinely charm-specific tests under `charms/*/tests/`
- [x] [test] Make `test_core.py` declare its config inline instead of implicitly inheriting `charms/k8s/config.yaml` from the working directory

### 3.5.3. Test entrypoints

- [x] [test] Fix root `tox.ini`, which pointed at a `tests/` and `src/` that no longer existed
- [x] [test] Fix root `pyproject.toml`, whose `testpaths` silently skipped the k8s suite
- [x] [test] Add `shared`, `machine`, `k8s`, `lint` and `integration` tox environments
- [x] [test] Rewrite `scripts/test.sh` to run all three suites and report per-suite results
- [x] [test] Keep `tests/integration` out of every default test path

### 3.5.4. Lint

- [x] [project] Add `ruff` config to the root `pyproject.toml`
- [x] [project] Set `line-length = 120` to match existing style rather than force a rewrap
- [x] [project] Exempt test files from `E501`, since they embed fixture data as literals
- [x] [python] Fix the findings: unused imports, unsorted imports, ambiguous `l` identifiers, two unused locals, one misplaced import block in `charms/machine/src/jaime/collector.py`

### 3.5.5. Coverage gap

- [x] [test] Add `tests/unit/providers/test_openrouter.py`; the provider had no tests at all

## 4. Phase 4 — Improving user experience

Make both charms pleasant to build, deploy and read output from.

### 4.1. Build and packaging

- [x] [project] Make `pack-machine` and `pack-k8s` write distinct artifacts that never delete each other's
- [x] [project] Add `pack-all` producing both charms in one run
- [x] [project] Stop `clean` from wiping `.venv/` and `.tox/`; split into `clean` and `distclean`
- [x] [project] Fix the `deploy` and `remove` targets: machine-only assumptions and the `PRINCIPLE_CHARM` typo
- [x] [project] Build into `dist/` so artifacts are collectable by CI
- [x] [project] Add `deploy-k8s` and `remove-k8s`, and validate `PRINCIPAL_CHARM` before packing

### 4.2. Kubernetes deployment guidance

- [ ] [charm] Add an action that emits the exact setup steps (RBAC, Juju user, secrets, config)
- [ ] [charm] Block until prerequisites are verified: controller authenticated and Kubernetes API readable
- [ ] [charm] Add an explicit RBAC preflight check instead of today's silent debug-level failure
- [ ] [docs] Fix `charms/k8s/README.md` `grant-secret` target — it takes an application, not a model
- [ ] [docs] Document granting the AI token secret to the application

### 4.3. Machine charm controller access

**Deferred.** This reverses the standing `AGENTS.md` rule that the machine
charm must not talk directly to the Juju controller API, and adds a
credentials surface to a charm that currently needs none. Write a design note
covering the tradeoff before implementing.

- [ ] [project] Design note: hook tools vs controller API, credential handling, what co-located subordinate monitoring actually requires
- [ ] [charm] Read unit status from the Juju controller API in the machine charm
- [ ] [charm] Monitor co-located subordinate units on the same machine
- [ ] [docs] Update the `AGENTS.md` rule and the `ARCHITECTURE.md` statement that this reverses

### 4.4. Config consistency

- [ ] [test] Assert shared option keys, types and defaults match across both charms
- [ ] [charm] Align the drifted descriptions: `api-token`, `watch-statuses`, `log-window-minutes`, `report-dir`

### 4.5. Report content

- [ ] [python] Add snap and service detail to machine incident reports
- [ ] [python] Add further pod and container detail to k8s incident reports
- [ ] [python] Bound every addition by time, lines or bytes and keep it within `max-context-lines`

### 4.6. Kubernetes diagnostics plan parity

The machine charm generates an AI diagnostics plan on `principal-relation-joined`
and passes it to its collector. The k8s charm does neither: `collect_context`
in `charms/k8s/src/jaime/collector.py` accepts a `diagnostics_plan` argument and
ignores it, and `charms/k8s/config.yaml` has no `diagnostics` option at all. So
k8s pod collection is a fixed set with no plan-driven extensibility. Promoted
from the `ARCHITECTURE.md` ideas list because it gates the CharmHub release.

- [ ] [charm] Add a `diagnostics` config option to `charms/k8s/config.yaml`
- [ ] [charm] Generate a diagnostics plan for watched applications and persist it
- [ ] [python] Pass the plan into the k8s `collect_context` and honour it
- [ ] [test] Cover plan-driven k8s collection, matching the machine charm's tests

## 5. Phase 5 — CI/CD, integration tests and CharmHub release

### 5.1. Continuous integration

- [x] [test] Run both unit suites and lint on every pull request
- [x] [test] Run all three suites — shared, machine, k8s — as a matrix
- [x] [test] Pack both charms on CI and upload them as artifacts
- [x] [test] Gate packing behind lint and unit so slow LXD work only runs when the fast checks pass

### 5.2. Integration tests

- [x] [test] Deploy both charms, inject a fault, assert incident → report → suggestion
- [x] [test] Cover the flapping-workload case that unit tests now guard
- [x] [test] Cover missing Kubernetes RBAC and rejected controller credentials
- [x] [test] Assert the API token never reaches reports or the audit log
- [x] [test] Assert the non-AI fallback still produces a report
- [ ] [test] Run the integration suite against a real controller and fix what the first run surfaces
- [ ] [test] Add the k8s integration job to CI once a MicroK8s runner is available

### 5.3. Release

Gated on 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6.

- [ ] [project] Publish both charms to CharmHub with tracks and channels
- [ ] [docs] Per-charm CharmHub page content

## 6. Phase 6 — Clustered operation for machine charms

Today a subordinate Jaime unit runs per principal unit, so a multi-unit application produces one independent incident, one LLM call and one report per unit, with no view of the cluster.

### 6.1. Leader aggregation

- [ ] [charm] Add a peer relation to the machine subordinate
- [ ] [charm] Followers publish compacted local context; the leader aggregates it
- [ ] [charm] Make one LLM call per cluster incident, owned by the leader
- [ ] [charm] Keep incident state in the peer application databag so it survives leader change
- [ ] [python] Leader-owned usage accounting across all units
- [ ] [python] Define the aggregation window across independent `update-status` cadences
- [ ] [python] Keep unit-level detection; add cluster-level aggregation on top

### 6.2. Multi-application monitoring

- [ ] [charm] Monitor a configured list of applications, as the k8s charm does
