"""Integration test for the flapping-workload case.

Covers TASKS.md 5.2. Jaime anchors the incident timer on when it first
observed a unit go unhealthy (``unhealthy_since``), not on Juju's ``since``
field. Juju bumps ``since`` every time a charm re-sets its status, including
re-setting the same status with a new message, so a workload stuck in a retry
loop would otherwise reset the timer forever and never reach
``failure-timeout-minutes``.

The unit suite guards this logic directly; this test proves it survives a
real Juju status stream.

Requires a bootstrapped machine controller (LXD).
