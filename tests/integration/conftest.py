"""Shared fixtures for Jaime integration tests.

These tests drive a real Juju controller. They are excluded from the default
unit sweep (root ``pyproject.toml`` sets ``testpaths = ["tests/unit"]``) and
must be invoked explicitly:

    make integration          # both substrates
    make integration-machine  # machine subordinate only
    make integration-k8s      # Kubernetes standalone only

Each substrate needs an appropriate controller to be bootstrapped and
selected: a machine cloud (LXD) for the machine charm, a Kubernetes cloud
(MicroK8s) for the k8s charm.
